Hello Dr. Fuller, 

I made this READ_ME file to explain the decisions I made in the assignment.
First, I chose to follow the same format that you used in the begin of the 
assignment slides with 15000 iterations and 0.1 learning rate. I also did the 
same trend with the 200, 50, and 10 neurons. All of the png files are saved 
in this file. The files are labeled with KK, the number being the number of neurons
initialized, and either init (the initial results before training) or final (the final
results after training). I did not do any animations because every time I tried I got
a "segmentation fault", which was probably a bug in my code. However, since you did not
specify the results that you would like to see, I thought that the initial and final 
plots would be good enough. 

Thank you for your time and if you have an questions, do not be afraid to ask!
